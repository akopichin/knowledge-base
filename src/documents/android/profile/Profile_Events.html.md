# Event Handling

## About

Profile allows you to subscribe to events, be notified when they occur, and implement your own application-specific behavior to handle them once they occur.

<div class="info-box">Your game-specific behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.</div>

## How it Works

Events are triggered when SOOMLA wants to notify you about different things that happen involving Profile operations.

For example, when a user posts a status, a `SocialActionStartedEvent` is fired as a result.

## Observing & Handling Events

For event handling, SOOMLA uses Square's great open-source project [Otto](http://square.github.io/otto/). In ordere to be notified of profile related events, you can register for specific events and create your game-specific behavior to handle them.

**In order to register for & handle events:**

1. In the class that should receive the event, create your event handler function with the annotation '@Subscribe'. Example:

    ``` java
    @Subscribe
    public void onLoginFinishedEvent(LoginFinishedEvent loginFinishedEvent) {
        // ... your game specific implementation here ...
    }
    ```

2. You'll also have to register your event handler class in the event bus (and unregister when needed):

   ``` java
   BusProvider.getInstance().register(this);
   ```

   ``` java
   BusProvider.getInstance().unregister(this);
   ```

<div class="info-box">If your class is an Activity, register in 'onResume' and unregister in 'onPause'.</div>

See a full [event handler example](https://github.com/soomla/android-profile/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidExample/src/com/soomla/example/ExampleEventHandler.java).
